Title: Poisson Log-linear Models with Spatio-temporal Random Effects
Version: 1.0
Date: 2014-08-05
Author: Duncan Lee
Maintainer: Duncan Lee <Duncan.Lee@glasgow.ac.uk>
Description: Implements a series of Poisson log-linear models with spatio-temporal random effects. The spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the random effects are induced using the class of Conditional AutoRegressive (CAR) priors, which are a special case of Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF). All models are fitted in a Bayesian context using Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) simulation.
