\title{
Spatio-Temporal Generalised Linear Mixed Models For Areal Unit Data
}

\description{
Implements a class of spatio-temporal generalised linear mixed models for areal 
unit data, with inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) simulation. The response variable can be binomial, Gaussian or Poisson,
but for some models only the binomial and Poisson data likelihoods are available. 
The spatio-temporal autocorrelation is modelled by random effects,  which are 
assigned conditional autoregressive (CAR) style prior distributions. A number of 
different random effects structures are available, and full details are given in 
the vignette accompanying this package and the references below. The creation of 
this package was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council 
(EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1 and the Medical Research Council (MRC) grant MR/L022184/1.
