\title{
Fit a spatio-temporal generalised linear mixed model to data, with a spatio-temporal
autoregressive process.
}

\description{
Fit a spatio-temporal generalised linear mixed model to areal unit data, where the 
response variable can be binomial, Gaussian or Poisson. The linear predictor is 
modelled by known covariates and a vector of random effects. The latter follows a 
multivariate first order autoregressive time series process, where spatial 
autocorrelation is modelled via the precision matrix. This precision matrix comes 
from the conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior proposed by Leroux et al. (2000), 
and the full model was proposed by Rushworth et al. (2014).  Missing values are 
allowed in the response in this model, and are sampled from in the model using 
data augmentation.. Further details are given in the vignette accompanying this 
package. Inference is conducted in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte 
Carlo (MCMC) simulation.

\arguments{
\item{formula}{
A formula for the covariate part of the model using the syntax of the lm() 
function. Offsets can be included here using the offset() function. The response 
and each covariate should be vectors of length (KN)*1, where K is the number of 
spatial units and N is the number of time periods. Each vector should be ordered 
so that the first K data points are the set of all K spatial locations at time 1, 
the next K are the set of spatial locations for time 2 and so on. The response can 
contain missing (NA) values.
}
\item{family}{
One of either "binomial", "gaussian" or "poisson", which respectively specify a 
binomial likelihood model with a logistic link function, a Gaussian likelihood 
model with an identity link function, or a Poisson likelihood model with a log 
link function.
}
\item{data}{
An optional data.frame containing the  variables in the formula.
}
\item{trials}{
A vector the same length and in the same order as the response containing the 
total number of trials for each area and time period. Only used if family="binomial". 
}
\item{W}{A non-negative K by K neighbourhood matrix (where K is the number of 
spatial units). Typically a binary specification is used, where the jkth 
element equals one if areas (j, k) are spatially close (e.g. share a common 
border) and is zero otherwise. The matrix can be non-binary, but each row must 
contain at least one non-zero entry.
}
\item{burnin}{
The number of MCMC samples to discard as the burn-in period.
}
\item{n.sample}{
The number of MCMC samples to generate.
}
\item{thin}{
The level of thinning to apply to the MCMC samples to reduce their temporal 
autocorrelation. Defaults to 1 (no thinning).
}
\item{prior.mean.beta}{
A vector of prior means for the regression parameters beta (Gaussian priors are 
assumed). Defaults to a vector of zeros.
}
\item{prior.var.beta}{
A vector of prior variances for the regression parameters beta (Gaussian priors 
are assumed). Defaults to a vector with values 100000.
}   
\item{prior.nu2}{
The prior shape and scale in the form of c(shape, scale) for an Inverse-Gamma(shape, scale) 
prior for nu2. Defaults to c(1, 0.01) and only used if family="Gaussian".   
}
\item{prior.tau2}{
The prior shape and scale in the form of c(shape, scale) for an Inverse-Gamma(shape, scale) 
prior for tau2. Defaults to c(1, 0.01).  
}
\item{rho.S}{
The value in the interval [0, 1] that the spatial dependence parameter rho.S is 
fixed at if it should not be estimated. If this arugment is NULL then rho.S is
estimated in the model. 
}
\item{rho.T}{
The value in the interval [0, 1] that the temporal dependence parameter rho.T is 
fixed at if it should not be estimated. If this arugment is NULL then rho.T is
estimated in the model. 
}
\item{MALA}{
Logical, should the function use Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA)
updates (TRUE) or simple random walk (FALSE, default) updates for the random 
effects and the regression parameters. Not applicable if family="gaussian".    
}
\item{verbose}{
Logical, should the function update the user on its progress.  
}
